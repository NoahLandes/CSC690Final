# CSC690 Final Project

For my final project I plan to make a game app. The game will be a simple platformer game with enemies coming at you that you can choose to kill or ignore. The player will be a ninja that can throw shurikens at an enemy by tapping the screen and can jump by swiping up. The game will have a never ending loop of enemies coming at the player until the player gets bored and quits or dies.

Must have features:
*Clear working controls stated to the player
*Working enemies that go in a fairly predictable pattern
*Quit button 
*Retry/restart option when the player dies
*A highscore list
  
Nice to have features:
*A boss type enemy every so many levels 
*A more complex ai that looks to start seeking the player out after so many levels as the difficuly rises
*Difficulty option
*Multiple abilities/weapons after unlocking them every so many levels
